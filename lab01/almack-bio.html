    <body>
        I am Victoria Almack and I am currently an Innovation, Society, and Technology major with a Data Analytics concentration. I am specifically interested in how humans interact with data, and how data shapes society and societal function. My studies so far have helped me learn SQL and Python coding, get a strong grasp of data ethics, and learn in depth about human centered design and it's importance. I am also a classically trained violinist, a national qualifier in speech and debate, and a recipient of the 1860 scholarship at SU. I haven been employed in many jobs including waitressing, working as an antiques dealer, labor-for-hire, and a tutor. Outside of work I enjoy reading, writing, knitting, and solving puzzles. I am from a small town in rural Iowa where the closest airport is a three hour drive away and have a lot of family still living in the area.
