            <p>Bryan, Ohio is home to the DumDums factory that makes every DumDums sucker, along with other Spangler branded candies. Bryan is a modern model of a company town with the factory being the main source of employment in Bryan, and many members of families work in the factory. The water tower for the town shows this clearly with large DumDums depicted on the tower instead of the town name as is common in most cities and towns. This is because many public amenities in Bryan such as water are owned by the factory, or family members of the owner of the factory. </p>
