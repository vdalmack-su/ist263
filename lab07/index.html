        <h1>Victoria's Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>I am Victoria Almack and I am currently an <strong>Innovation, Society, and Technology major </strong> with a Data Analytics concentration. I am specifically interested in how humans interact with data, and how data shapes society and societal function. </p>
        <h2>School History</h2>
        <p>My studies so far have helped me learn SQL and Python coding, get a strong grasp of data ethics, and learn in depth about human centered design and it's importance. I am also a classically trained violinist, a national qualifier in speech and debate, and a recipient of the 1860 scholarship at SU. </p> 
        <h2>Employment Background</h2>
        <p>I have been <strong>employed in many jobs </strong> including:
            <ul> 
                <li> waitressing </li> 
                <li> working as an antiques dealer </li>
                <li> labor-for-hire </li>
                <li> a tutor</li> 
            </ul>
        <p>Outside of work I enjoy reading, writing, knitting, and solving puzzles. I am from a small town in rural Iowa where the closest airport is a three hour drive away and have a lot of family still living in the area.</p>
